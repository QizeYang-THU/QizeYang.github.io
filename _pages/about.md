My name is Qize Yang, and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the School of Integrated Circuits, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. Shouyi Yin and Assoc. Prof. Yang Hu. I obtained my B.E. degree from the the School of Integrated Circuits, Tsinghua University in 2023. 

My research interests lie in the field of computer architecture and systems, with a particular focus on emerging hardware for AI workloads, including wafer-scale computing architectures, integrated architecture design, and cluster-level communication, scheduling, and mapping optimization.
